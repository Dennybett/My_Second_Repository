# My_Second_Repository

This is my second repository
I made it on Oct 8th

I have added a few brief descriptions just because
This is overwhelming but fun 

So have finally successfully cloned the repo to the directory 
Only took 7 eons
I thought I had it but nope
I think I got it now, but let's confirm
YES!! I have successfully pulled it into the local repo


Now, we are editing this through a branch. We have created "Branch -1" and I want to see how this will go.

Without pulling Branch -1 into the local, We have created Branch -2 and we will try to pull them together to see what the end result will be.

Okay, I was unable to push into here but I am going to pull into the local just for the motivation
AAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!

We are back!
